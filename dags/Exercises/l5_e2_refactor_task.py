# INSTTRUCTION
#  In this exercise, weâ€™ll refactor a DAG with a single overloaded task into a
#  DAG with several tasks with well-defined boundaries
#   1 - Read through the DAG and identify points in the DAG that could be split
#       apart
#   2 - Split the DAG into multiple tasks
#   3 - Add necessary dependency flows for the new tasks
#   4 - Run the DAG
